# Cross-Lingual Contrastive Steering & Arbitration Profiling

A mechanistic-interpretability pipeline that **measures and then mitigates**
cross-modal conflict in Vision-Language Models across a low-resource language
axis. Where [`../inference`](../inference) *measures* whether a VLM trusts its
eyes or defers to a misleading caption, this package goes one step further: it
extracts the model's internal **abstain-vs-assert direction** in the residual
stream and **steers** the model along it at inference time — then asks how well
that honesty direction **transfers across languages**.

Built on top of the `../inference` codebase: same model loader, same four
multilingual counterfactual datasets, same MCQ taxonomy. This package adds
activation caching, contrastive-vector derivation, forward-hook steering, and
cross-lingual transfer evaluation.

---

## The behavioural taxonomy (shared with `../inference`)

Every conflict item is a 4-option MCQ (image-bias / text-bias / distractor,
shuffled across A/B/C, plus a fixed **D = abstain**). The five outcome
categories map one-to-one onto the methodology's metric codes:

| Metric | Category (`../inference/classify.py`) | Meaning |
|--------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| **CR** | `conflict_abstain` (chose D) | Conflict Rate — honest abstention |
| **VR** | `image_bias` | Image Reliance — faithful to the image |
| **TR** | `text_bias` | Text Override — follows the misleading caption (**failure**) |
| **DR** | `distractor` | Distractor |
| **IR** | `other` | Incorrect / parse failure |

---

## The 6-phase pipeline (`run_steering.py`)

| Phase | Name | What it does |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **1** | Perception Control | Score each item image-only (no caption). **Keep only items the model gets right** (`image_bias`), so downstream failures are arbitration errors, not blindness. → `phase1_perception.jsonl` |
| **2** | Conflict Profiling | Re-score the validated set **with** the counterfactual caption (+abstain D). Classify CR/VR/TR/DR/IR and **cache the last-token residual stream at every layer** (+ a logit-lens abstain-vs-answer trace). → `phase2_conflict.jsonl`, `activations/<model>__<lang>.npz` |
| **3** | Target-Layer Localization | Select the decoder-depth band `[frac_lo, frac_hi]` (default 0.5–0.8) for caching and steering. |
| **4** | Contrastive Vector | Per language, per target layer *k*: `v̂⁽ᵏ⁾ = normalize( μ_abstain⁽ᵏ⁾ − μ_assert⁽ᵏ⁾ )` from the **fit split**. → `vectors/<model>.npz` |
| **5** | Inference-Time Steering | Add `α·v̂⁽ᵏ⁾` to the residual stream via forward hooks; sweep α; pick the α that **maximises CR while holding off-target perception accuracy**. → `phase5_alpha_sweep.jsonl` |
| **6** | Cross-Lingual Transfer | Apply every fit-language vector to every target language's **eval split** (all-pairs matrix). Transfer Gap(S→T) = TR[S→T] − TR[T→T]. → `phase6_transfer.jsonl` |

### The "success" set caveat

The contrastive vector points from *assert* (`text_bias`) toward *abstain*
(`conflict_abstain`). Most VLMs abstain rarely, so a language may have too few
abstentions to estimate `μ_abstain`. When that happens (`< min_class`) and
`fallback_success: true`, the success set is widened to `conflict_abstain ∪
image_bias` — i.e. steer toward *"do not blindly follow the misleading text"*.
Each language's actual success set is recorded in `vectors/<model>_meta.json`.

---

## How steering works mechanically (`steer_common.py`)

- **`decoder_layers(lm)`** locates the LM decoder-layer stack across VLM families
  by collecting `*DecoderLayer` modules and picking the group whose size matches
  the LM's reported layer count (skips vision-tower `*EncoderLayer` blocks).
- **`steer(layers, layer_vecs, α)`** is a context manager that registers a
  forward hook on each target layer adding `α·v̂` to that layer's output hidden
  states (all positions), and removes the hooks on exit.
- **`forward_score(...)` / `forward_score_batch(...)`** do one forward pass:
  argmax over A/B/C/D answer-token logits = the answer (the same logit-scoring
  path as `../inference`), and optionally return per-layer last-token activations
  and a logit-lens `logit(D) − logit(best answer)` trace across depth.

No autoregressive decoding is used for scoring — steering is evaluated on the
same fast single-forward logit path as the benchmark.

### Throughput (batched scoring)

All phases score in **right-padded batches** (`batch_size`, default 8) via
`mdl.build_inputs_batch` — the same batched path the benchmark uses. Because
right padding keeps each row's real tokens at positions `0..n-1`, the per-row
answer is read at `attention_mask.sum(dim=1) − 1` (last real token); the steering
hook adds `α·v̂` to the whole `[B, seq, hidden]` tensor unchanged.

The α-sweep and transfer phases **pre-build each language's eval batches once**
and reuse them across every α and every source vector — only the forward hook
changes between passes, never the (expensive-to-preprocess) inputs. A batch that
errors falls back to per-item scoring so one bad row never drops its chunk.
Lower `batch_size` if Phase 2 (which also holds `output_hidden_states` for the
batch) hits OOM.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r ../inference/requirements.txt    # same deps as the benchmark

# Full default run (config.yaml): qwen2.5-vl-3b, all datasets/languages
./run.sh

# Quick smoke run (use any of the 9 benchmarked models)
MODELS="qwen2.5-vl-3b" DATASETS="feliren" LANGUAGES="english hindi telugu" \
  MAX_PER_GROUP=20 EVAL_CAP=30 OUTPUT_DIR=steering_smoke ./run.sh

# Analysis only (re-draw tables/figures from existing artifacts)
python analyze_steering.py --output_dir steering_results
```

`run.sh` runs `run_steering.py` (Phases 1–6) then `analyze_steering.py`
(tables + figures). All knobs are env vars — see the header of `run.sh`.

## Notes & limitations

- **Scoring is single-forward logit-argmax** (no decoding), in right-padded
  batches of `batch_size`. The α-sweep and transfer phases re-score eval items
  once per α / source (reusing pre-built batches) — `eval_cap` bounds this.
- **Steering vectors are derived on the fit split and evaluated on the held-out
  eval split**, so reported steering effects are not fit on their test items.
- **Off-target accuracy** is measured on the *perception-control* condition under
  the same steering, guarding against a vector that buys abstention by breaking
  perception.
- Activation caching stores all `L+1` layers (for the logit-lens). For very large
  sweeps, narrow the depth band or cap rows to bound disk/RAM.
- Dataset inconsistencies are inherited from upstream and acknowledged as a
  dataset limitation, consistent with the benchmark.
